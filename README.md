# Scenario Classifier

Classifying different scenarios (city, desert, mountain, nature, sea, universe) using computer vision.

Project built using Python: Keras (with Tensorflow backend), Numpy, scikit-learn have been used.

**How to install it**

```$ git clone https://github.com/marcogdepinto/Tesseract-OCR.git```

```$ pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt```

**How to run it**

Run ```predictions.py```. The script will return the classification report and the confusion matrix of the model.

Actually the model has an F1 score of 91% on test data.

If you want to train again the model changing the parameters, do your changes in ```train.py``` and then launch it.
